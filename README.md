## Overview

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum / Foundations Course. A rock, paper, scissors game built to practice JavaScript foundations, DOM manipulation, and work with branches.

This project was made for two assignments, [the first only running on the console](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), and [the second using a UI](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors).
